        NYU Economics Department<br /></span>
        New York, NY<br />
        June 2015 -<br />
        <br />
        As a Research Assistant under Professors Thomas Sargent (NYU) and
        George Hall (Brandeis), my job is to write Python programs to clean
        and analyze economic data related to the financing of the American
        Revolution -- specifically, the fluctuation of prices of government
        bonds that were sold to fund the war, and information about the
        people who held those bonds. Also, I've helped translate a lot of
        Matlab code into Python.

        <br />
        <br />
        Skills learned: <span class="highlight">Financial data analysis,
          Scientific Python libraries, Matlab, economic history of the US</span>

        January 2015 - May 2016<br />
        <br />
        At this job, I was responsible for setting up and fixing classroom
        technology for use by the professors. Common tasks included working with
        video cameras and sound systems, setting up lecture recordings,
        fixing projectors, troubleshooting
        basic PC problems, teachings professors how to use Microsoft
        Powerpoint, and doing regular office work like answering the phone
        and responding to emails.

        New York, NY<br />
        April 2015 - June 2015<br />
        <br />
        This is a service that you can text to do things for you (for free),
        like order food, book flights, make restaurant reservations, etc.
        As an intern, my job was to respond to the texts from the users, and
        complete whatever tasks they wanted done. I would also
        help with marketing campaigns.
        <br />
        <br />

        Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates<br />
        September 2014 - November 2014<br />
        <br />
        My responsibilities at this internship included network maintenance
        and software testing. Since NYU's new campus on Saadiyat Island was
        built very recently, there were still a lot of problems with internet
        connectivity when I was there, so the majority of my time
        was spent testing and logging wireless access points and
        ethernet ports to look for broken ones.

        <br />
        At this strategic consulting firm, my job as an intern included data
        entry, paperwork, and making phone calls. This was my first chance to

        May 2010 - August 2014<br />
        <br />
        My first job. When I started working at this supermarket as a teenager, my responsibilities were to
        do janitorial work, attend to the parking lot, and help customers. After a couple years, I was
        promoted to the Produce Department, where my job was to chop up and package fruits and vegetables,
        stock the shelves, help customers, etc. This job helped develop my character and work ethic,
        and was an invaluable experience.

        <span class="highlight">Teaching Computer Programming -</span> I've taught the basics of computer programming
         to several of my friends, and in some cases
        it has actually helped them find a job. If you want to learn, just let me know! I'll
        teach anyone for free, as long as I have enough time.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="highlight">Translating Class Notes -</span> During my last year of college,
        I helped one of the professors in the Economics department translate all his class notes
        from Matlab to Python.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="highlight">Game Development -</span> In my spare time, I like to program simple computer games.
        I mostly write them in JavaScript, using the p5.js library. For example,
