    <h1>About me:</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a student at <span class="highlight">New York University,</span> majoring in <span class="highlight">
      Economics</span> with a minor in <span class="highlight">Computer Science.</span> Some of my hobbies include
      music, chess, pretending to be cool, basketball, and reading about history.

    </p>

    <p>
      I'm also a
      <span class="highlight">freelance computer programmer</span> and am always looking for new
      projects to work on. Pay is negotiable, and for fun stuff I might even do it for free.
      For startups, I'll consider taking equity instead of cash.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
      I'm not sure what I want to do yet in terms of an actual long-term career and I'm definitely
      open to working in any field, but right now I'm especially interested in jobs related to
      technology, national security, humanitarian work, federal law enforcement, non-profits,
      computer programming (any industry), or startups/entrepreneurship (any industry).
    </p> -->

    <p>
      This website is meant to be a portfolio of my computer programming work, but I'm also open to non-technical
      work, so feel free to contact me about that too.
    </p>

        January 2015 -<br />
        <br />
        At this job, I am responsible for setting up and fixing classroom
        technology for use by the professors. Common tasks include working with
        video cameras and sound systems, setting up lecture recordings,
        fixing projectors, troubleshooting
        basic PC problems, teachings professors how to use Microsoft
        Powerpoint, and doing regular office work like answering the phone
        and responding to emails.
        <br />
        <br />
        Skills learned: <span class="highlight">Operating and troubleshooting audio/visual technology,
        general office work</span>

        New York, NY<br />
        June 2015 - September 2015<br />
        <br />
        As a Research Assistant and Python Developer under Professors Thomas
        Sargent (NYU) and George Hall (Brandeis), my job was to write software
        to analyze economic data related to the financing of the American
        Revolution. This job was my first chance to apply my programming
        skills to financial analysis. Even though the data I was analyzing
        was from the 1700s, a lot of the software I wrote could just as
        easily be used to analyze current economic data.
        <br />
        <br />
        Skills learned: <span class="highlight">Financial data analysis, Scientific Python libraries,

        New York, NY<br />
        April 2015 - June 2015<br />
        <br />
        This is a service that you can text to do things for you (for free),
        like order food, book flights, make restaurant reservations, etc.
        As an intern, my job was to respond to the texts from the users, and
        complete whatever tasks they wanted done. I would also occasionally
        help with marketing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Skills learned: <span class="highlight">Customer service, social media marketing, working in a

        Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates<br />
        September 2014 - November 2014<br />
        <br />
        My responsibilities at this internship included network maintenance
        and software testing. Since NYU's new campus on Saadiyat Island was
        built very recently, there were still a lot of problems with internet
        connectivity when I was there, so the majority of my time
        was spent testing and logging wireless access points and
        ethernet ports to look for broken ones.

        November 2012 - May 2013<br />
        <br />
        At this strategic consulting firm, my job as an intern included data
        entry, paperwork, and making phone calls. This was my first chance to
        work in an office environment, and was a great learning experience.

        <br />
        My first job. When I started working at this supermarket as a teenager, my responsibilities were to
        do janitorial work, attend to the parking lot, and help customers. After a couple years, I was
        promoted to the Produce Department, where my job was to chop up and package fruits and vegetables,
        stock the shelves, help customers, etc. When I was in high school I worked here year-round, and after
        I left for college, I would still come back to work during the winter and summer breaks.
